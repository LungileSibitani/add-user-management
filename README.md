User Management System
Overview
This project is a User Management System that allows for managing user data efficiently with a frontend and backend architecture. The system is currently set up to run locally, with a Go backend and a Vue.js frontend. A MySQL database is used to persist data.

Installation and Setup
1. Clone the Repository
You can access the repository by visiting the GitHub link:
https://github.com/your-username/https://github.com/ add-user-management
Clone it to your local machine:

cd your-repo-name
________________________________________
2. Backend Setup (Go + MySQL)
1.	Ensure Go is installed (go version).
2.	Navigate to the backend folder:
3.	cd backend
4.	Install dependencies using Go modules.
5.	Configure the MySQL connection in the backend code (update host, user, password, and database name).
6.	Create a MySQL database called go_dev (or your chosen name).
7.	Run the backend server:
8.	go run main.go
The backend will run locally on http://localhost:8080.

3. Frontend Setup (Vue.js)
1.	Ensure Node.js and npm are installed.
2.	Navigate to the frontend folder:
3.	cd frontend
4.	Install dependencies:
5.	npm install
6.	Start the development server:
7.	npm run serve
The frontend will run locally on http://localhost:8081 (or a similar port).

Database Setup
To connect the system to your database:
1.	Install MySQL locally.
2.	Create a database named go_dev.
3.	Update the backend configuration file with your database username, password, and host.
4.	Run migrations or let the application auto-create tables if supported.
________________________________________
Running the Full System
1.	Start the backend server (Go).
2.	Start the frontend development server (Vue).
3.	Open the browser at the frontend address to interact with the system.
4.	The frontend communicates with the backend, which in turn connects to the MySQL database.
